      <h1>
        Welcome to Dylan Lyman's Young Scientist Academy, where every child is a
        scientist!
      </h1>
      <h2>About The Academy</h2>
      <img src="./dylan.jpg" class="full-width" alt="Mrs. Dylan Lyman" />
      <p>
        My Young Scientist Academy is geared toward children ages 6-10. I am a
        USOE-certified science teacher with 8 years of science teaching
        experience. My goal is to help kids build confidence by thinking and
        discovering their way through challenging science projects. We will do
        experiments, collect data, work as a team, and learn what it means to be
        a scientist. Each child brings their own "lab coat" (an oversized
        long-sleeve shirt) and I provide the rest!
      </p>
      <h2>Signing Up</h2>
      <p>
        Each class is enrolled separately. Your child is welcome to come to any
        or all of the classes; content will not carry over from class to class.
        There are 12 (previously 8) spaces per class. If the class you wanted is
        full, please email me at dylanlyman21@gmail.com and I'll add you to the
        waitlist; if you don't get in, you'll get priority registration for that
        class the next time it is offered.
      </p>
      <h2>Classes</h2>
      <p>
        Each class runs from 1-3:45 pm on the day listed. The content for each
        class is breifly summarized under the "Classes" tab.
      </p>
      <h2>Cost and Payment</h2>
      <p>
        Each class costs $20/child, which is all-inclusive. You pay me directly
        (cash or Venmo: @DylanLyman21).
      </p>
      <h2>Safety</h2>
      <p>
        All activities at my Young Scientist Academy are age appropriate. I take
        every necessary step to keep children safe and they will be provided
        with ample instruction and reminders on how to stay safe. Please
        emphasize to your child the importance of following directions in order
        to stay safe and have fun. Students will be required to bring their own
        "lab coat" (an oversized long-sleeved shirt) that can be ruined.
        Protective eyewear and gloves will be provided. If you want your child
        to take any additional safety measures, you may notify me in advance. By
        signing up to participate, you are agreeing to release me, Dylan Lyman,
        from any liability in the highly unlikely case of injury.
      </p>
