      <h2>Monday June 3, 2019 - Ooey Gooey Oobleck</h2>
      <p>
        Young children will have fun getting messy simulating quicksand and the
        asthenosphere of the earth with Oobleck. Scientific curiosity starts with and is fed by play, so we will put our curiosity to work experimenting with and playing with slime!
      </p>
      <h2>Monday June 17, 2019 - I'm Sensing Science!</h2>
      <p>
        Scientists make observations using their five senses. Young kids will love practicing their scientific observation skills by experimenting with their five senses in this class!
        We will try to identify different objects using only smell, only taste,
        and only touch. We also have fun experiments with sound and sight.
      </p>

      <h1 id="age6">Classes for ages 6-9 (2 hour 45 minute classes, 1:00-3:45 pm)</h1>
      <h2>Wednesday June 5, 2019 - Blast Off!</h2>
      <p>
        We are going to build and launch rockets and do other exciting outer space
        adventure experiments! This class will absolutely talk about black holes!
      </p>
      <h2>
        Monday June 10, 2019 - Science is Magic! (Repeat from Spring Break)
      </h2>
      <p>
        This class will teach kids TEN different magic tricks that are really
        just amazing science experiments. Some of these experiments are keeping
        things dry under water, making water disappear, and making an orb
        levitate!
      </p>
      <h2>Wednesday June 12, 2019 - The Coolest Chemistry</h2>
      <p>
        This class has some of my favorite mind-blowing chemistry experiments!
        We will make color disappear in water, change the density of water to
        make objects sink or float, and make different shaped crystals.
      </p>
      <h2>Wednesday June 19, 2019 - Under Pressure!</h2>
      <p>
        These experiments with both air and water pressure are sure to amaze! We
        will see how temperature affects pressure by compressing a soda can
        using heat and cold. We will also do awesome experiments with air
        pressure including stabbing a potato using only a drinking straw and
        levitating a ping pong ball.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Monday June 24, 2019 - What am I Eating?! (Repeat from Spring Break)
      </h2>
      <p>
        This class is a food-based class, where kids learn what really makes up
        some of the foods they eat. We will make curds and whey, butter and
        buttermilk, experiment with how yeast ferments, and do a few fun
        experiments teaching us how to make scientific observations using our
        five senses.
      </p>
      <h2>Wednesday June 26, 2019 - A Long, Long Time Ago</h2>
      <p>
        This class focuses on the ancient formation of rocks and fossils. We
        will learn about and see different minerals, simulate the formation of each of the different
        types of rocks in the rock cycle, then kids will be able to make a
        fossil. Plus kids will get to examine and explore many different rocks
        and minerals!

      <h2>Thursday June 6, 2019 - Solar Power!</h2>
      <p>
        We will learn how to harness the power of the electromagnetic spectrum
        through the sun! We will build and use solar ovens, experimenting to see
        who can design the most efficient oven. Once we understand how the sun
        emits UV rays we will experiment with how sunscreen protects us and run
        an experiment to see how we can best protect ourselves from harmful UV
        rays.
      </p>
      <h2>Thursday June 13, 2019 - Motors, Batteries and Magnets</h2>
      <p>
        This exciting class will start with a lemon battery, and help us
        understand how electricity is transferred. Then we can build our own
        amazing self-drawing pens! We can also see how to use a battery and
        pencils to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen gas bubbles
        (electrolysis). We will also play with some super strong magnets, which
        is guaranteed fun.
      </p>
      <h2>Thursday June 20, 2019 - High Pressure Diving</h2>
      <p>
        This class goes even more into depth on how both air and water pressure
        affect us. Ever wondered how a submarine can sink and rise? In this class we will answer that question by building and experimenting with cartesian divers. We will learn how pressure
        varies with depth and experiment with both air and water pressure. It
        turns out that "No Pressure" isn't a comfortable place to be!
      </p>
      <h2>Thursday June 27, 2019 - It's pH! Awesome Acids and Bases</h2>
      <p>
        Acids and bases are fundamental (and fun!) in Chemistry! We will learn
        how they work and experiment with some commonly found acids and bases.
        We will use both a homemade indicator solution and scientific indicator
        strips to test pH. We will also learn how to do titrations.
