        Classes for ages 4-6 ($15 per child, 90 minute classes, 10-11:30 am and
        2:00-3:30 pm)
      </h1>
      <h2>Monday June 3, 2019 - Ooey Gooey Oobleck</h2>
      <p>
        Young children will have fun getting messy simulating quicksand and the
        asthenosphere of the earth with Oobleck. Scientific curiosity starts
        with and is fed by play, so we will put our curiosity to work
        experimenting with and playing with slime!
      </p>
      <h2>Monday June 17, 2019 - I'm Sensing Science!</h2>
      <p>
        Scientists make observations using their five senses. Young kids will
        love practicing their scientific observation skills by experimenting
        with their five senses in this class! We will try to identify different
        objects using only smell, only taste, and only touch. We also have fun
        experiments with sound and sight.
      </p>

        Classes for ages 6-9 ($25 per child, 2 hour 45 minute classes, 1:00-3:45
        pm)
      </h1>
      <h2>Wednesday June 5, 2019 and Thursday June 6, 2019 - Blast Off!</h2>
      <p>
        We are going to build and launch rockets and do other exciting outer
        space adventure experiments! This class will absolutely talk about black
        holes!
      </p>
      <h2>
        Monday June 10, 2019 - Science is Magic! (Repeat from Spring Break)
      </h2>
      <p>
        This class will teach kids TEN different magic tricks that are really
        just amazing science experiments. Some of these experiments are keeping
        things dry under water, making water disappear, and making an orb
        levitate!
      </p>
      <h2>Wednesday June 12, 2019 and Thursday June 13, 2019- The Coolest Chemistry</h2>
      <p>
        This class has some of my favorite mind-blowing chemistry experiments!
        We will make color disappear in water, change the density of water to
        make objects sink or float, and make different shaped crystals.
      </p>
      <h2>Wednesday June 19, 2019 - Under Pressure!</h2>
      <p>
        These experiments with both air and water pressure are sure to amaze! We
        will see how temperature affects pressure by compressing a soda can
        using heat and cold. We will also do awesome experiments with air
        pressure including stabbing a potato using only a drinking straw and
        levitating a ping pong ball.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Monday June 24, 2019 - What am I Eating?! (Repeat from Spring Break)
      </h2>
      <p>
        This class is a food-based class, where kids learn what really makes up
        some of the foods they eat. We will make curds and whey, butter and
        buttermilk, experiment with how yeast ferments, and do a few fun
        experiments teaching us how to make scientific observations using our
        five senses.
      </p>
      <h2>Wednesday June 26, 2019 - A Long, Long Time Ago</h2>
      <p>
        Calling all dinosaur and rock lovers! This class focuses on the ancient
        formation of rocks and fossils. We will learn about and see different
        minerals, simulate the formation of each of the different types of rocks
        in the rock cycle, then kids will be able to make a fossil. Plus kids
        will get to examine and explore many different rocks and minerals!

      <!-- <h2>
        Thursday June 13, 2019 - It's Electric! Magical Motors, Batteries and
        Magnets
      </h2>
      <p>
        Electricity is amazing! We will start with a turning on a light using a
        lemon to transfer the electricity. Then we'll build a motor to operate
        our own self-drawing pens! We will also see how to use only a battery
        and pencils to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen gas bubbles
        (electrolysis). We will also play with some super strong magnets, which
        is guaranteed fun.
      </p> -->
      <h2>Thursday June 20, 2019 - High Pressure Diving</h2>
      <p>
        Ever wondered how a submarine can sink and rise? In this class we will
        answer that question! This class goes even more into depth (pun
        intended) on how pressure affects us. We will experiment with cartesian
        divers and be able to bring one home. We will learn how pressure varies
        with depth and temperature. When you leave this class you'll know we're
        only comfortable the way we are because of air pressure... it turns out
        that "No Pressure" isn't a comfortable place to be!
      </p>
      <h2>Thursday June 27, 2019 - It's pH! Awesome Acids and Bases</h2>
      <p>
        Did you know your stomach acid is one of the strongest acids on earth
        and if you get that acid on your skin it will burn you? We are going to
        learn a ton about the human body as we experiment with acids and bases.
        Have you seen the baking soda and vinegar volcano? That's a base
        reacting with an acid! I will have some unique acids and bases for us to
        learn with and you better believe we'll do some reactions. We will use
        both a homemade indicator solution and scientific indicator strips to
        test pH and we will learn how to do titrations. pH is fundamental in
        chemistry... and it's so fun!
      </p>
      <h2>Coming in July - Solar Ovens!</h2>
      <p>
        The sun is the most powerful thing in our solar system... think how
        powerful we'd be if we could harness that power! Well... we can! We will
        learn how to harness the power of the sun by making and using a solar
        oven to cook food. And we will experiment to see who can design the most
        efficient oven. While the sun can give us the most useful energy, it can
        also burn us! So we will experiment with how sunscreen protects us from
        the harmful UV rays of the sun and run an experiment to see how we can
        best protect ourselves from harmful UV rays using UV detectors.
