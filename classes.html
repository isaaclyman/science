      <h2>Monday April 1, 2019 - What Am I Eating?</h2>
      <p>
        This food-based class will help kids discover what's in the food they
        are eating every day. We will do experiments to extract and analyze
        iron, starch, sugar, and fat from various foods we eat, as well as
        experiment with yeast and fermentation.
      </p>
      <h2>Wednesday April 3, 2019 - Can You Engineer It?</h2>
      <p>
        This class is all about engineering challenges. We will be building
        spaghetti towers, newspaper bridges and clay boats, and protecting a
        Pringle from a falling object using only paper and tape.
      </p>
      <h2>Thursday April 4, 2019 - Science Is Magic!</h2>
      <p>
        This class teaches magic tricks based on physics and chemistry! We will
        be making invisible ink, levitating orbs, and learning about the
        invisible forces all around us.
