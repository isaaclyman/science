      <h2>Monday July 1, 2019 - Bubble-palooza!</h2>
      <p>
        What makes bubbles different from foam? Can you actually make bubbles
        that don't pop? Can you make a bubble that is as tall as a person?
        There's nothing quite so fun as playing with super strong bubbles!
      </p>
      <h2>Monday July 15, 2019 - Science and Art -- Colors!</h2>
      <p>
        Are some colors really made up of other colors? We'll do a science
        experiment to prove that they are! Thanks to color dyes we can see
        multiple scientific phenomena including capillary action and surface
        tension. At the end of class every child will bring home a color-dyed
        carnation!

      <h2>
        Thursday June 13, 2019 - The Coolest Chemistry (This class will be
        repeated again on Thursday, July 11!)
      </h2>
      <p>
        **FIVE SPOTS LEFT** This class has some of my favorite mind-blowing
        chemistry experiments! We are going to do the Elephant Toothpaste
        Reaction and the Iodine Clock reaction that are so incredible, they feel
        like magic tricks! As if that's not enough, we will also make different
        shaped crystals.
      </p>

      <p></p>
      <h2>Wednesday June 26, 2019 - A Long, Long Time Ago</h2>
      <p>
        **ONE SPOT LEFT** Calling all dinosaur and rock lovers! This class
        focuses on the ancient formation of rocks and fossils. We will learn
        about and see different minerals, simulate the formation of each of the
        different types of rocks in the rock cycle, then kids will be able to
        make a fossil. Plus kids will get to examine and explore many different
        rocks and minerals!
      </p>
      <h2>
        Tuesday July 2, 2019 - Epic Chemical Reactions
      </h2>
      <p>
        Chemistry never ceases to amaze! Forget the baking soda vinegar
        volcanoes, come see some other amazing acid/base reactions! A simple
        acid base reaction here can make invisible ink reappear. We'll also
        experiment with how to make an egg float, sink and hover in water.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Monday July 8, 2019 - Science is Magic! (Repeat Class)
      </h2>
      <p>
        This class will teach kids TEN different magic tricks that are really
        just amazing science experiments. Some of these experiments are keeping
        things dry under water, making water disappear, and making an orb
        levitate!
      </p>
      <h2>
        Thursday July 11, 2019 - Spectacular Solar Ovens! (Also offered for ages
        9-12 on July 12)
      </h2>
      <p>
        The sun is the most powerful thing in our solar system... think how
        powerful we'd be if we could harness that power! Well... we can! We will
        learn how to harness the power of the sun by making and using a solar
        oven to cook nachos! These ovens can reach hundreds of degrees. Come
        learn about the sun and the greenhouse effect that keeps us all warm.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Wednesday July 17, 2019 - Under Pressure! (Repeat Class)
      </h2>
      <p>
        These experiments with both air and water pressure are sure to amaze! We
        will see how temperature affects pressure by compressing a soda can
        using heat and cold. We will also do awesome experiments with air
        pressure including stabbing a potato with a drinking straw and
        levitating a ping pong ball.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Thursday July 23, 2019 - It's Electric! (Also offered for ages 9-12 on
        July 22)
      </h2>
      <p>
        Come build squishy circuits using conductive playdoh and LEDs! We'll
        also make scribble robots using simple motors. Did you know that static
        electricity and magnetism can make it appear that something is floating?
        Electricity is amazing!
      </p>
      <!-- <h2>
        Monday June 24, 2019 - What am I Eating?! (Repeat from Spring Break)
      </h2>
      <p>
        This class is a food-based class, where kids learn what really makes up
        some of the foods they eat. We will make curds and whey, butter and
        buttermilk, experiment with how yeast ferments, and do a few fun
        experiments teaching us how to make scientific observations using our
        five senses.

        Thursday June 20, 2019 - High Pressure Diving (This class is $25 due to
        supply cost)
      </h2>
      <p>
        *FOUR SPOTS LEFT* Ever wondered how a submarine can sink and rise? In
        this class we will answer that question! This class goes even more into
        depth (pun intended) on how pressure affects us. We will experiment with
        cartesian divers and be able to bring one home. We will learn how
        pressure varies with depth and temperature. When you leave this class
        you'll know we're only comfortable the way we are because of air
        pressure... it turns out that "No Pressure" isn't a comfortable place to
        be!

      <h2>
        Thursday June 27, 2019 - It's pH! Awesome Acids and Bases (This class is
        $25 due to supply cost)
      </h2>
      <p>
        *FIVE SPOTS LEFT* Did you know your stomach acid is one of the strongest
        acids on earth and if you get that acid on your skin it will burn you?
        We are going to learn a ton about the human body as we experiment with
        acids and bases. Have you seen the baking soda and vinegar volcano?
        That's a base reacting with an acid! I will have some unique acids and
        bases for us to learn with and you better believe we'll do some
        reactions. We will use both a homemade indicator solution and scientific
        indicator strips to test pH and we will learn how to do titrations. pH
        is fundamental in chemistry... and it's so fun!
